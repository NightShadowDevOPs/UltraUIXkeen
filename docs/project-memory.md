# Project memory — UI Mihomo / Ultra

## Stable project facts
- Main repository: `NightShadowDevOPs/UltraUIXkeen`
- Local folder: `Y:\Мой диск\Git\UltraUIXkeen`
- Router path: `/opt/UltraUIXkeen`
- UI updates on the router are done through the built-in UI updater, not through `git pull`
- In router command blocks always include `clear`
- If `router-agent` changes, sync the version in `install.sh`, status API and documentation
- Automatic SSL-certificate checks for proxy providers must stay intact

## Current validated baseline
- UI: **v1.2.149**
- router-agent: **0.6.32**

## Latest delivered step
- `v1.2.149` kept the conservative agent-side telemetry cache from `v1.2.148`, then added UI-side request dedupe/cache and stable live-snapshot fallback so Overview/Traffic graphs stop flapping on brief telemetry misses

## Current development direction
- continue reducing overhead in the Traffic workspace without touching the real packet-forwarding path
- observe what can be borrowed from upstream only when it is cheap operationally and does not add constant polling pressure
- preserve normal work of the Overview traffic weights chart while lightening the UI/runtime contour
